House rules for git in this project:

1.0: Create a new branch for every feature.

1.1: After finishing the feature merge the branch back into development.

1.3: Branches should contain short version of maintainer and the feature which you implement.
     e.g. "FWI-Login" as in "FelixWill-Login" or "CGO-Filter" as in "ChristianGommans-Filter".

2.0: Only merge into master for a new release. 

2.1: Deploy newest version on server after creating new release tag.
